# Reviewing-Unallocated-Space-Extracting-Data-with-Tools-Digital-Investigation-Processes
## AIM:
To review unallocated space in a disk image, extract data using forensic tools, and understand the digital investigation process.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Use tools like Autopsy or Sleuth Kit (blkls, icat) to identify and analyze unallocated space.

### Step 2:
Extract data from unallocated space and examine for hidden or deleted content.

### Step 3:
Document and interpret findings as part of the digital investigation process.

## PROGRAM:
Data Extraction and Investigation Tool Usage
